# Interactive Sunshine Recorder

Welcome to the Interactive Sunshine Recorder! Visit: https://interactive-sunshine-recorder.vercel.app/

This project provides a web-based simulation of a Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder, an instrument used to measure the duration of sunshine.

## What it Does

The simulation allows users to:
* Understand the basic principle of how a Campbell-Stokes recorder works.
* Visualize how sunlight is focused by a glass sphere to burn a trace on a recording card.
* Simulate the sun's movement across the sky using a "Time of Day" slider.
* Toggle between "Sunny" and "Cloudy" conditions to see how it affects the recording.
* Observe the burn marks forming on the card, representing the hours of bright sunshine.
* Reset the card to start a new observation.

This interactive tool is designed to be an educational resource to help understand a classic meteorological instrument.

## Demonstration
